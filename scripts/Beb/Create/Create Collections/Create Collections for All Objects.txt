Beb.Tools - Create Mesh Collections Script
==========================================

Description:
This script organizes all top-level mesh objects
in the scene by creating a dedicated collection
for each parent mesh. The mesh and its children
(if any) are moved into the new collection,
preserving their hierarchy.

Usage:
1. Add mesh objects (e.g., cubes) to your scene.
2. Open the N-Panel (press N).
3. Go to the "Beb.Tools" tab.
4. Select this script from the list.
5. Click "Run" to run the script.

What It Does:
- Deselects all objects in the scene.
- For each top-level mesh object (no parent):
  - Creates a new collection "[MeshName]_Collection".
  - Unlinks the mesh from existing collections.
  - Links the mesh to its new collection.
  - Moves child objects with their parent.
- Prints debug info to the console.

Notes:
- Only processes top-level mesh objects (no parent).
- Child meshes stay parented and move with their parent.
- Ignores non-mesh objects (e.g., cameras).
- No selection needed; processes all qualifying meshes.
- Collection names get a suffix (e.g., .001) if duplicated.

Output:
- See console message:
  "Current scene: [SceneName]"
  "All objects in scene:"
  " - [ObjectName], Type: MESH, Parent: [ParentName]"
  "Found [N] parent mesh objects"
  "Processing mesh: [MeshName]"
  "Created collection: [MeshName]_Collection"
  "Mesh objects organized into collections complete!"
