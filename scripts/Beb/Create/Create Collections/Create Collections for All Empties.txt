Beb.Tools - Create Empty Collections Script
===========================================

Description:
This script creates a collection for each
top-level empty object not already in a
custom collection and moves it and its
children into that collection.

Usage:
1. Add empty objects (e.g., Plain Axes) to your scene.
2. Open the N-Panel (press N).
3. Go to the "Beb.Tools" tab.
4. Select this script from the list.
5. Click "Run" to run the script.

What It Does:
- Deselects all objects in the scene.
- For each top-level empty (no parent):
  - Skips if already in a custom collection.
  - Creates a collection "[EmptyName]_Collection".
  - Unlinks the empty and its children from Scene Collection.
  - Links the empty and its children to the new collection.

Notes:
- Only processes top-level empties not in custom collections.
- Moves all child objects (any type) with their parent empty.
- Ignores non-empty top-level objects (e.g., meshes).
- No selection needed; processes qualifying empties.

Output:
- See console message:
  "Empty objects and their children organized into"
  "collections complete!"
